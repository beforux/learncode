--HOW TO USE GIT and GITHUB--

核心概念：同步,代码的世界好抽象啊。
- Mac系统中下载git,获得RSA，把RSA在github setting中输入，确认关联。
- github上一个文件夹，先需要在github上新建一个repository
- 注意点，要在本地文件夹目录下 init，所以需要 cd XXX , cd XXX
- 本地一个文件夹，但注意，本地文件夹并不是新建就可以的，还需要加入默认的轨道里，可以假想还有一个文件夹。
git add/git commit -m"comment."
- git push -u origin master

常用代码：
git add
git commit -m
git push -u origin master
